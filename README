Corridor Defence (Tower Defence game)

Note:
All features are implemented; however, the actual parameters are not fine-tuned,
leading to unbalanced gameplay. You may have to use the money cheat (press m)
to be able to build enough defences to stop the enemies

Features:

3-panel store with radio-button-like interface and info panel
 - click on an item in the store to see a description

Place and delete turrets and traps
 - place turrets and traps by selecting an item in the store
   and clicking a grid spot in the playing field. Each spot can
   hold at most 1 turret and 1 trap. Items can also be placed
   by holding space and moving the mouse over the playing field
   (be careful - this can be expensive!)
 - delete items by selecting the desired item on the field and
   clicking the Delete button or pressing d

Upgrades for the Door (castle)
 - upgrade your door by selecting an upgrade from the Door menu
   and then clicking on the door
   
Speed controls
 - the game can be paused indefinitely by clicking the || button
   or by pressing p. Items can still be placed while paused,
   however the Wave Timer will also continue to increase
 - click the > button or press s to speed up the game
   (only speeds up movement - reload and wave timers are unaffected)
   
Scoring
 - for every enemy you destroy before it reaches the final door,
   you get 1 point and some dollar value of money
 - use money to buy upgrades and items
 - play to get the highest score possible!
 
Miscellaneous
 - display of how long until the next wave, as well as the enemy type
   and count of next wave
